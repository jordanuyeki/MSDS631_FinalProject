# Face Mask Detection Using Neural Networks

**By**: Matthew Hui and Jordan Uyeki

This repository contains our final project for our MSDS 631: Deep Learning course, which is the final course in our Masters in Data Science program at the University of San Francisco. 

## Our Goal 
For this project, we wanted to leverage various neural network models to classify whether or not an individual in a given image is wearing a face mask. With the ongoing pandemic and various mask mandate rules being enforced around the world, we feel that our project could have many practical implications. For example, in a more advanced application, our final model could be used to analyze surveillance camera footage snapshots and flag people who are potentially violating mask mandates.  

## The Data
The dataset we chose to work with is the [COVID Face Mask Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/prithwirajmitra/covid-face-mask-detection-dataset) from Kaggle. This dataset contains over 1000 images, which each fall into two distinct categories: 
- The Mask Wearers:

- The Non Mask Wearers:
